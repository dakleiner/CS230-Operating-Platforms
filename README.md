# CS230-Operating-Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was our client, They are a new gaming studio looking to create an online game but they lack the expertise in online development.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel that my research into the different operating systems.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found that working on this document gave me direction as to how I needed to develop my code. Especially when we developed the UML’s and doing research into what patterns we should use.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to pick which area to improve, I would pick the recommendation section.  To improve this section, I would go into more detail in each section.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I feel that the client’s needs were straightforward here.  They required an architect that would allow for the most amount of people to play their game across multiple operating systems.  It is important to consider the user’s needs as they are the ones that will be actually using the product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach was to begin with a UML where I would develop the structures with known software patterns that would work.  In the future I would continue to use this pattern starting with the clients needs followed by UML and then start to code.
